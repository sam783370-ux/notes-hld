>Functional Requirement instagram news feed

1)create post
2)follow unfollow
3)new feed
4)like comment
5)user notification

>Non-functional Requirement

1)Availablility - system should be available 99.999% of time
2)Eventual consistency - if user post something may not be show up immediately but appears within few seconds
3)latency - if we click on home button newsfeed should load in 1-2seconds.
4)scalability - 500 M DAU and 2 B MAU
5)Extensibility - easier to extend in future like replying to a comment post recommendation or ads.
6)Usability -


>Capacity Estimation

- DAU MAU
- Throughput
- Storage
- Memory
- Network


> why capacity estimation?
- determine numer fo servers and databases
- cost management
- decide type and specification of all hardware.
- helps us determine if read heavy or write heavy system


> thoroughput

DAU-500M
MAU-2B


read throughput - 500,000,000 * 100;
                  50,000,000,000  


write throughtput 
500M * 

1 week -> 500M -> 1
7days -> 1

1 day-> 1/7*500



>storage

500M - 

1 week - 1 follow
7days - 1
1 day - 1/7 single user
(1/7)*(500M)*365*10

>Memory

Cache memory
amount of cache memory 1% of daily storage

>Network bandwidth


Ingress data incoming into our system per second
Daily storage in a 216 tb

216/(24*60*60) - 2.5 gb /s


Egress Calculation-
    read request 50b/day

    sum(number of post of respective content type*(proportion))*50b/24*60*60
